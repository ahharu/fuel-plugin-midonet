Installation Guide
==================

Install the Plugin
------------------

To install the MidoNet Fuel plugin:

#. Download the plugin from the `Fuel Plugin Catalog`_

#. Log into Fuel Master node and install the plugin using the
   `Fuel CLI <https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-7.0/user-guide.html#using-fuel-cli>`_:

   ::

    # fuel plugins --install midonet-fuel-plugin-3.0-3.0.1-1.noarch.rpm

#. Verify that the plugin is installed correctly:
   ::

    # fuel plugins
    id | name    | version | package_version
    ---|---------|---------|----------------
    9  | midonet | 3.0.1   | 3.0.0


Enable Experimental Features
----------------------------

To be able to use MidoNet Fuel plugin correctly, Fuel `Experimental Features`_
must be enabled. This is done automatically by plugin post-install script,
assuming the plugin is installed on top of clean Fuel master installation.
In case the process has to be done manually, follow these steps:

#. Modify the ``/etc/fuel/version.yaml`` file in *Fuel Master*
   host to add ``experimental`` to the ``feature_groups`` list in the ``VERSION``
   section, just below ``mirantis`` item:

   ::

      VERSION:
      ...
      feature_groups:
        - mirantis
        - experimental

#. Restart the *Nailgun* container with dependencies by running::

   # dockerctl restart nailgun
   # dockerctl restart nginx
   # dockerctl shell cobbler
   # cobbler sync
   # exit

#. Make sure the *nginx* and the *nailgun* docker services finished the restart
   process before go on with the new section::

   # dockerctl check


Create the MidoNet roles
------------------------

MidoNet core functionality depends on two roles that are not provided by Fuel
on default:

- the **NSDB** role, which deploys the Network State DataBase services, namely
  ZooKeeper and Cassandra.

- the **Gateway** role, which provides the MidoNet gateway service needed for
  handling external *OpenStack* traffic. (See `MidoNet Fuel Plugin User Guide`_ for
  more info about networking in MidoNet)

The above roles are added automatically by plugin post-install script,
assuming the plugin is installed on top of clean Fuel master installation.
In case the process has to be done manually, follow these steps:

NSDB role
`````````

#. Create a YAML file with the **NSDB** role definition, like this:

   ::

    name: nsdb
    meta:
      name: Network State Database for MidoNet
      description: MidoNet Synchronization Services
    volumes_roles_mapping:
      - allocate_size: min
        id: os

#. Name it, for instance, ``nsdb.yaml``. Push the role for the environment
   (``Ubuntu 2015.1.0-7.0``) using the
   `Fuel CLI <https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-7.0/user-guide.html#using-fuel-cli>`_:

   ::

    $ fuel release
    ---|----------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------
    2  | Kilo on Ubuntu 14.04 | available   | Ubuntu           | 2015.1.0-7.0
    1  | Kilo on CentOS 6.5   | unavailable | CentOS           | 2015.1.0-7.0

   ::

    $ fuel role --create --release 2 --file nsdb.yaml


Gateway role
````````````

#. Create the role for **MidoNet Gateway** by creating a file called
   ``gateway.yaml`` with the following contents:

   ::

    name: midonet-gw
    meta:
      name: MidoNet HA Gateway
      description: MidoNet Gateway
    volumes_roles_mapping:
    - allocate_size: min
      id: os

#. Create the role for the environment (``Ubuntu 2015.1.0-7.0``) using the
   `Fuel CLI <https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-7.0/user-guide.html#using-fuel-cli>`_:

   ::

    $ fuel release
    ---|----------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------
    2  | Kilo on Ubuntu 14.04 | available   | Ubuntu           | 2015.1.0-7.0
    1  | Kilo on CentOS 6.5   | unavailable | CentOS           | 2015.1.0-7.0

   ::

    $ fuel role --create --release 2 --file gateway.yaml


Edit the Fuel deployment graph dependency cycle
-----------------------------------------------

The roles that were just added needs to be accompanied with appropriate
deployment tasks, so that `Fuel's Deployment Graph
<https://docs.fuel-infra.org/fuel-dev/develop/modular-architecture.html#granular-deployment-process>`_
is fully populated. Again, needed deployment tasks are added automatically by
plugin post-install script, assuming the plugin is installed on top of clean
Fuel master installation. In case the process still has to be done manually,
follow these steps:

#. Create a group type for Fuel |FuelVer| in a YAML file called
   ``/tmp/midonet_groups.yaml`` with the following content::

    - id: nsdb
      parameters:
        strategy:
          type: parallel
      requires:
      - deploy_start
      required_for:
      - deploy_end
      role:
      - nsdb
      type: group
      tasks:
      - logging
      - hiera
      - globals
      - netconfig
    - id: midonet-gw
      parameters:
        strategy:
          type: parallel
      required_for:
      - deploy_end
      requires:
      - deploy_start
      role:
      - midonet-gw
      tasks:
      - logging
      - hiera
      - globals
      - netconfig
      type: group


#. Download the deployment tasks for the **release 2** (``Ubuntu 2015.1.0-7.0``):

   ::

    $ fuel release
    ---|----------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------
    2  | Kilo on Ubuntu 14.04 | available   | Ubuntu           | 2015.1.0-7.0
    1  | Kilo on CentOS 6.5   | unavailable | CentOS           | 2015.1.0-7.0

   ::

      fuel rel --rel 2 --deployment-tasks --download

#. A file ``./release_2/deployment_tasks.yaml`` will be downloaded.

#. Without moving from your current directory, append the
   ``/tmp/midonet_groups.yaml`` file into the ``deployment_tasks.yaml``:

   ::

      cat /tmp/midonet_groups.yaml >> ./release_2/deployment_tasks.yaml

#. Upload the edited ``deployment-tasks`` file to the ``release 2``:

   ::

     fuel rel --rel 2 --deployment-tasks --upload


#. Current Fuel Plugins framework only allows to apply tasks on
   *pre_deployment* and *post_deployment* stages, adding these groups
   and tasks into the main graph will allow **NSDB** and **Gateway**
   associated tasks to:

   - Configure *logging* to see Puppet and MCollective logs related to the tasks
     from the Fuel Web UI.

   - Access to hiera variables.

   - Access to global variables.

   - Configure the IP addresses for
     `each Fuel network type <https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-7.0/reference-architecture.html#network-architecture>`_.

Verifying installation
----------------------

MidoNet MEM Fuel Plugin replaces Neutron default OpenvSwitch networking plugin in a
typical OpenStack deployment based on Neutron. Therefore, the goal of the verifying
the system that has just been deployed is to to ensure that plugin installation was
successful as well to ensure that OpenStack Neutron networking supported by MidoNet
is fully functional. Basic fuel OSTF health check provides a solid base for
verifying basic OpenStack as well as MidoNet functionality, it is highly advised
to make sure that this particular set of OSTF tests are passing correctly:

#. Sanity tests: 

   - Request list of networks

#. Functional tests:

   - Check network connectivity from instance via floating IP (requires functional BGP setup)
   - Check network parameters
   - Launch instance with file injection (requires functional BGP setup)

|

Although the list is somewhat short, executing these functional tests successfully will
ensure that a larger set of MidoNet functionality is operating correctly. Just to mention
few: MidoNet NSDB, MidoNet REST API, MidoNet Neutron plugin integration, MidoNet
networking agents, MidoNet BGP gateway including Floating IPs.
